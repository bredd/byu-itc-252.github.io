title: Midterm Exam Review
session: S17

* Lab 3, Buffer Overflow Bomb, is underway! Feel free to collaborate as you figure things out.
    * We're having problems with phase 3 in that it doesn't behave the same way under gdb as it does standalone and it often gives you a segment fault after success. For now, it's acceptable to to have that seg fault and complete it with or without gdb. We'll give an update in class and on Slack as we figure this out.
    * We're having even more problems with phase 4. We may not require that step. Please watch Slack and in-class announcements for updates.
* Floating Point Quiz 5 and HW 5 are both posted on LearningSuite. Start working on them!
