* Seeking another TA for IT&C 210 next fall.
* Quiz 9 (Virtual Memory) due Today!
    * Worked examples from today should help with the quiz.
* Homework 7 (Virtual Memory) Due Friday
    * Worked examples from today should also help with this. You can also get help from the TAs and in the Friday lab.
* S26, Exceptional Control Flow and Linking, will not appear on any exam or homework. It's valuable information but too late in the semester for assignments.
* Final Exam Review will be Wednesday, April 19.
* Lab 5 (Memory) due Wednesday, April 19 (Last Day of Class)
* Final Exam
    * Comprehensive, but with an emphasis on the post-midterm content.
    * Will be take-home, open book, open internet.
    * Opens the first day of finals and closes the last day of finals.
    * The exam will be auto-scored immediately upon submission. You will only see the exam score, not individual question scores.
    * You can retake up to 4 times for a total of 5 attempts.
    * Take note of your answers if you expect to retry. Answers will NOT be carried from one attempt to the next.
