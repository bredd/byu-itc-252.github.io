* Repeat: Lab 1, Binary Bomb, is up. Though we had to make some tweaks on Friday. Get started early. Tools will be discussed today and Wednesday. The due date will likely be extended because of the launch problems.
* Quiz 3 has not been hand scored yet. Don't trust the auto-score.

OK to work in groups for everything except quizzes. When in doubt, check "Academic Standards" in LearningSuite > Content.
