* Midterm Exam: Instead of reviewing everyone's comments for partial credit I focused my effort on preparing the retake. If you have an answer you want me to review, please contact me.
* Repeat: Midterm Retake
    * Details are in LearningSuite > Announcements (and your email)
    * The retake is optional. If you're satisfied with your grade you can skip it.
    * Each question on the retake corresponds to one on the midterm. You'll get the better of the two scores. (No risk to the retake.)
