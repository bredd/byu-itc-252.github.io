* Lab 4 (Cache Lab) is up on LearningSuite!
* Lab 5 (Virtual Memory) Coming soon for those who want to work ahead.
* Overall, you did *much* better on the Midterm Retake.
    * The autograder should be accurate though I haven't yet reviewed individual scores.
    * The retake doesn't automatically update your midterm score. I will be handling that in the next few days.
