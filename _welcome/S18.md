* Midterm Exam: Instead of reviewing everyone's comments for partial credit I focused my effort on preparing the retake. If you have an answer you want me to review, please contact me.
* Lab 3, Buffer Overflow Bomb
    * It's acceptable to have a segment fault AFTER the Phase 3 exploit.
    * To turn in the lab, please submit, in LearningSuite, .zip file containing a screenshot of your phase 3 working plus the .txt file containing the input you used.
    * Phase 4 is extra credit. And don't waste too much time on it because we're not sure it can be done on this build without a segment fault.
* Midterm Retake
    * Details are in LearningSuite > Announcements (and your email)
    * The retake is optional. If you're satisfied with your grade you can skip it.
    * Each question on the retake corresponds to one on the midterm. You'll get the better of the two scores. (No risk to the retake.)
