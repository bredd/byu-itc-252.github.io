Remember. You can use your textbook, internet, or other resources for all Homework, Labs, and Quizzes. You can collaborate with your classmates on Homework and Labs but Quizzes should be your individual work. Regardless, please don't copy exact answers from the internet. Best to find pages that describe the principles of the issue.
