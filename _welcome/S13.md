### Midterm Exam Opens After Class Today

"This exam is open book and notes. You can use the internet, including search, in read-only mode. That is, you can search for keywords but don't post questions from the exam to any website whether it's a forum or AI.

"This is an individual task. Do not work with others.

"Most of the questions have an "explain your answer" field enabled. Do NOT feel like you need to explain all of your answers. This field allows you to show your work on questions where I may award partial credit for having the right approach but not arriving at the correct answer, like questions where you are asked to calculate something."
