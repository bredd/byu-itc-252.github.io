* Repeat: Lab 1, Binary Bomb, is up. Though we had to make some tweaks on Friday. Get started early. Tools will be discussed today and Wednesday. The due date will likely be extended because of the launch problems. Seeking your feedback on when it should be due.
* Quiz 3 has not been hand scored yet. That will be done today.
* Kahoot! Today. Get devices ready.

OK to work in groups for everything except quizzes. When in doubt, check "Academic Standards" in LearningSuite > Content.
